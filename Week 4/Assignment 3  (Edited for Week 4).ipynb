For example, if we have an overview \"a brown dog\", and our vocab is \\[a brown, big, cabbage, dog, goat, cow, turkey\\], the one-hot vector would be \\[1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0\\]. If our overview is \"a big brown dog\", the one-hot vector would be \\[1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0\\]. If our overview is \"a big big brown dog\", the one-hot vector would be \\[1,1,2,0,1,0,0,0\\].
